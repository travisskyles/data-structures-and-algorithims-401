# Breadth First Traversal

Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input.

## Challenge

Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.

## Approach & Efficiency
* breadthFirst - O(n)

## API
* breadthFirst - traverses a binary tree using a breadth first approach and outputs a list of the values.
