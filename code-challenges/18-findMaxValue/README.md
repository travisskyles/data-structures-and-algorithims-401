# Breadth First Traversal

Write a function that finds the highest value in a Binary Tree.

## Challenge

Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency
* findMaxValue - O(n)

## API
* findMaxValue - traverses a binary tree inOrder and returns the highest value.
