# Array Shift

This is a function that takes in an array and outputs the reverse.

## Challenge

Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency

For this challenge I decided to work the problem in two parts. Initially I created a new empty array and then used a while loop and an iterator to set the new array values equal to the input array until reaching the middle index. Then the new value is inserted and another while loop is used to finish inserting the remaining values.
