# Reverse an Array

This is a function that takes in an array and outputs the reverse.

## Challenge

Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency

I decided to create a new empty array to store the new values.
Then I also needed to create a variable to store the value of the ascending index.
Then using a for loop to reverse iterate through the original array I set the value of the new array at an index equal to the counter to the value of the original array at the index of "i".
Then the counter iterated up a number and the process repeats for the length of the original array before returning the new array.
