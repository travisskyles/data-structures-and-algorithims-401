# FizzBuzzTree

Create a function that replaces values in a binary tree.

## Challenge

Create a function fizzBuzzTree that replaces value divisible by 3 & 5 with fizzbuzz, by 5 with buzz, and by 3 with fizz. If the value is not divisible by any of those then it is replaced by a string of that value.

## Approach & Efficiency
* fizzBuzzTree - O(n)

## API
* fizzBuzzTree - replaces value in a binary tree with fizz, buzz, fizzbuzz, or a string of that value.
