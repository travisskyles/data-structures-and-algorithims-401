# Singly Linked List

Create a singly liked list module.

## Challenge

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
- Create insert() method to add to the list.
- Create includes() to check for if a value is in the list.
- Create toString() to generate a string representation of the list and its values.

## Approach & Efficiency
I created a Node class that stores the value as well as the connection to the next node. Then I created a class for the list itself to track what the head of the list is pointing to.

Each of the functions within this have an efficiency of O(n).
