# Depth First Graph Challenge

Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph

## Challenge

Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. 

## Approach & Efficiency
* `getEdge` - 0(n^2)

## API
* `depthFirst(graph)` - Takes in a graph and returns an array of values in depth first order
