# Repeated Word Challenge

Write a function that returns the first repeated word.

## Challenge

Write a function that takes in a long string. It should return the whatever word is repeated first.

## Approach & Efficiency
* `split(string, delimiter)` - O(1)
* `repeatedWord(string)` - O(n)

## API
* `split(string, delimiter)` - Splits the string at the delimiter and pushes each split into an array
* `repeatedWord(string)` - Finds the first repeated word in a string of words
