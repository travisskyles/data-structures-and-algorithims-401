# Get Edge Challenge

Given a business trip itinerary, and an Alaska Airlines route map, is the trip possible with direct flights? If so, how much will the total trip cost be?.

## Challenge

Write a function based on the specifications above, which takes in a graph, and an array of city names. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.

## Approach & Efficiency
* `getEdge` - 0(n^2)

## API
* `getEdge(graph, locations)` - Takes in a graph and an array of locations and determines whether you can get through the whole trip on direct flights and gives you the cost.
